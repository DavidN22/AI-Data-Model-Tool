### Manuel Data-Model Inserts
Prefer to take matters into your own hands? Create tables manually with ease and even integrate them into AI-generated models. Alternatively, enhance AI-generated models by adding your custom tables. The process is flexible, letting you transition between manual and AI-assisted workflows effortlessly.
